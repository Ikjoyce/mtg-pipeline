Can I do all this (including the two modes I choose) within my Declare Attackers phase and not necessarily at the end of the Declare Attackers phase? Which means I can declare additional attackers even after resolving Caesar's abilities? Example:\n   1. I declare a Human token as an attacker\n   2. I sacrifice the aforementioned attacking Human token as well\n   3. I choose two modes of Caesar and resolve both\n   4. **(Is this legal?)** *I declare my other creatures as attackers as well*\n2. Until when can I sacrifice another creature? Must the sacrifice be done immediately, during a specific step, or as long as it's in the combat phase, or maybe even during my turn? Example:\n   1. I declare a Human token as an attacker\n   2. We move to the Declare Blockers/Combat damage phase\n   3. Opponent kills the attacking Human token either via blocking damage or instant abilities\n   4. **(Is this legal?)** *I sacrifice the attacking Human token first and trigger my two modes*\n      1. *And am I understanding correctly that if this were legal, my two tapped and attacking tokens won't be included in combat this turn?*\n\nI'm about a month into MTG and am learning the rules as much as I can, but this specific ability confuses me since it isn't as straightforward as the others. The other posts about this did help me understand Caesar more, but these two specific cases are kind of difficult for me to break down."}
