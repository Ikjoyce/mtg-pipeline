Can I order triggers such I decide not to pay the echo cost, so the creature sacrifices itself, and then in that same upkeep I return it to my hand with the trigger of Oath which I had on the stack?\n\n\nThanks!!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No. Oath of Ghouls says (annotated):\n\n> At the beginning of each players upkeep, that player chooses **target player (a) whose graveyard has fewer creature cards in it than their graveyard does and (b) is their opponent**. [...]\n\nThe target player must satisfy both conditions, at the time you choose targets. When you choose targets, you and your opponent both have 0 creature cards in graveyard. So you cannot choose your opponent as the target, as that choice doesn't satisfy (a).\n\nWhat Oath of Ghouls does *not* say is, it doesn't target the creature card. So if you have 1 creature card and they have 0, then you *can* choose your opponent as target, and let the echo trigger resolve first and then return the sacrificed creature into your hand (instead of the creature already in your graveyard). That can work. But again, you need to be able to target the opponent in the first place.\n\nAlso, wow that card's phrasing is confusing."
