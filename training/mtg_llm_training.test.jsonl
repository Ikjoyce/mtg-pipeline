But my question would be then would something like Academy Manufactor trigger on those artifacts as well? It specifies in the text of him that it only makes the artifacts \"Foods\" in addition to their other types and Academy Manufactor specifies that the cards created have to be either a treasure TOKEN, a clue TOKEN, or a food TOKEN. going even further on this, Academy Manufactor specifies that the tokens must be CREATED and wouldn't the lobster ability be a casting trigger? not a creation trigger? If I am wrong about all of this please let me know as this came up in a game recently and I did not object to any of the additional tokens being made but wanted to have this knowledge in case it comes up in the future. Much appreciated!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ragost and Manufactor don't interact in any way.  \n  \nEven if you created a 1/1 rabbit token with both out, you aren't creating a food token, despite the soldier token becoming a 1/1 artifact creature - food soldier on the field."}], "metadata": {"confidence": 0.8, "interaction_type": "triggered_ability", "rule_references": []}}
