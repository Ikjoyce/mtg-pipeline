My guess is that you can't reduce further to -7 but you could go the opposite way to make it easier to activate the ability.\n\n  \nThanks in advance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, making -6 go to -3 isn't reducing it, so I would say your reading is correct.\n\nThat being said: Truss is a silver-bordered/acorn card, which tend to play fast and loose with the rules and which are not legal by default in any formats.
