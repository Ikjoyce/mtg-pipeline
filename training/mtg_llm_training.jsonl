I've tried looking at the rulings and other people's posts but I keep getting contradicting information. My main questions are: \n\nAre there any lands that count as multicolored despite lacking a mana cost? I'd assume no, but the gold border is also said to be a sign that a card is multicolored and there are quite a few gold bordered lands. \n\nAlso, how do flip cards factor into this? If a card is mono-blue on one side but flips into a blue-green colored permanent does it only count as multicolored after it flips or does it never count because it has no mana cost on the flipped side? \n\nI guess the main thing I'm looking for is some sort of succinct explanation for the ruling. Do I only worry about mana cost or are there other factors that need to be taken into account? Thanks in advance. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ">105.2.

A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.\n\nmostly you care about mana cost to determine color. some cards will have an ability like [[transguild courier]] or a color indicator like [[Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar]]\n\nfor double faced cards only the face that is currently showing matters"}

Can I do all this (including the two modes I choose) within my Declare Attackers phase and not necessarily at the end of the Declare Attackers phase?

I sacrifice the aforementioned attacking Human token as well\n   3. I choose two modes of Caesar and resolve both\n   4. **(Is this legal?)** *I declare my other creatures as attackers as well*\n2.
